The logo and the brand name “ReactPHP” are not part of the MIT license, and can only be used commercially by the ReactPHP project on products, websites, and publications.

Under the following conditions, third parties may use the ReactPHP logo as well:

- The logo can only be used to point to the product ReactPHP. When used with a link on a web page, it should point to the URL http://reactphp.org/.
- You will visualize and promote your own branding more prominent than you use the ReactPHP logo. The ReactPHP logo only can be used as a secondary brand, which means it has to be clear for an average viewer that this is not an official ReactPHP website, publication or product.
- You can use the ReactPHP logo on promotion products, such as T-shirts or caps or trade show booths, provided it is a secondary brand as described in point 2.
- The logo is used unaltered, without fancy enhancements, in original colors, original typography, and always complete (logo + text ReactPHP).
- In case you use the logo on products you sell commercially, you always have to contact us with a picture of how it will be used, and ask for explicit permission.
